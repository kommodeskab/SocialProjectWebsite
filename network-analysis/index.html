Each node in the graph is an airport, and each edge is a flight between the airports. The <strong>weight</strong> of each edge is the number of flights on that route, and the <strong>degree</strong> of each node is the number of connections to other airports. Each node/airport also contains a set of attributes collected from the data:</p><ol><li>City</li><li>Country</li><li>Latitude</li><li>Longitude</li><li>Airport name</li><li>Continent</li><li>BNP per capita</li><li>Average recommendation</li><li>Average recommendation per BNP</li><li>Numer of reviews</li></ol><p>Using the latitude and longitude, we were able to visualize our graph using each nodes spatial position. Beneath, we have visualized nodes using their degree and edges using weights (separately, to make things more manageable):

<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kommodeskab/SocialProject/main/images/flightmap_nodes.png alt="Graph nodes">
<em><strong>Top pane</strong>: flight routes between airports. The routes have been visualized as &ldquo;great circles&rdquo;, i.e. the shortest path between two points on a globe. <strong>Bottom pane</strong>: All the different airports. The bigger the dot, the higher degree.</em></p><p>Evidently, the most air traffic occurs in Europe, Eastern Asia and North America. Not surprising√¶y, in North Africa, except along the coast, almost no air traffic occurs, due to the Sahara dessert and the low population density.</p><p>To investigate a network, we have to understand why we are doing it. So with the network analysis, we aim to answer the following research questions:</p><ol><li>Where are the best airports located in the world?</li><li>Are these airports connected to other airports of high quality?</li><li>And, when adjusted for BNP per capita, where are the best airports compared to regional development?</li></ol><p>The first step is to find the one of the most basic properties of our network, G, which is the degree. The degree describes how many connections each airport has, and this is a valuable insight. Here we have the degree distribution and the log-log scale of the distribution.</p><p><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kommodeskab/SocialProject/main/images/degree.png alt=Degree></p><p>At first, we see a skewness of the degree distribution, this indicates that there exists a lot of airports with few connections and few airports that are well-connected. This aligns well with the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoke%E2%80%93hub_distribution_paradigm>spoke-hub distribution paradigm</a>, which is important in transport networks and means that some airports connect multiple airports. Furthermore, due to the graph, being a real-world graph a heavy tail was expected. The log-log plot further emphasizes that our graph follows a power-law distribution and the graph also shows that there are few nodes (airports) with very high connectivity. These function as major international traveling hubs, which means that they connect many airports and have an important role as a bridge between them, as predicted by the spoke-hub distribution. This tells us about the nature of the network.</p><p>Now we have to look into the mean, mode, median, maximum, and minimum degree. The network showed a pretty big difference in all of the values(see Explainer), reflecting that there is an influence of highly connected airports. Furthermore, the network shows a moderate clustering coefficient, indicating regional clustering despite the low density. This could mean that not all potential connections are utilized and that the network is sparsely connected but still regionally clustered. To finish up the initial analysis, the network is in the supercritical regime, aligning with typical behavior observed in real networks that have surpassed the critical point.</p><p>The next thing is to start answering the questions. To do this we need a measure of how good the airports are. An alternative to recommendations and reviews could be centrality measurements. Therefore we performed a centrality analysis on the network regarding closeness, eigenvector, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality>betweenness centrality</a>. What we found was the scatterplot on the left:</p><p><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kommodeskab/SocialProject/main/images/Centrality_measures.png alt="Centrality measures"></p><p>Here is a brief description of the values. Closeness describes how fast you can come to all the other airports, and eigenvector centrality gives a measure of the influence of an airport given the neighbors. Last is the betweenness centrality, which tells how often the airports act as a bridge in the shortest path. As the graph tells us, the closeness centrality tells us that highly connected airports tend to have many connections. However, the results of the eigenvector centrality, reveal that even airports with less degree can influence the network. Lastly, the betweenness score does not give us a clear tendency, which makes sense given that airports with lower degrees still can hold an important influence.</p><p>We had to come up with a way to combine these centrality measures, in such a way that each measure was weighted. What we went with was the <a href=https://www.statisticssolutions.com/composite-scores/>composite score</a>, with the formula:</p><div>$$
\begin{gather*}
\text{Composite centrality}=\frac{1}{3} \cdot \left( \frac{Cc(n)}{\max(CC(n) | n \in G)} \frac{EC(n)}{\max(EC(n) | n \in G)} + \frac{BC(n)}{\max(BC(n) | n \in G)} \right) \\
CC = \text{Closeness Centrality}, \hspace{5mm} EC = \text{Eigenvector centrality}, \hspace{5mm} BC = \text{betweenness centrality}
\end{gather*}
$$</div><p>Here is a list to show the 6 most central airports:</p><ol><li>Charles de Gaulle International Airport (0.98)</li><li>Frankfurt am Main Airport (0.94)</li><li>Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (0.89)</li><li>Dubai International Airport (0.84)</li><li>London Heathrow Airport (0.81)</li><li>Istanbul Airport (0.80)</li></ol><p>The point of using this score is to combine the three different ways of incorporating and analyzing the different centrality aspects of the network in one score.</p><p>The first step toward an answer to the research questions is now possible if we see the composite score as a way to describe a ‚Äúgood‚Äù airport. To analyze this we looked at the assortativity (The tendency for nodes to connect to other nodes with similar properties within a network and goes -1 to 1, where 1 is an assortativ network where all nodes only connects to those of the same degree) for 4 different topics: Degree, country, continent, and composite score. To do this, we used different formulas, one for scalar values and one for categorial values. What we found was that there is a tendency for airports within the same continent to have connections with a value of 0.80. On the scale of countries the assortativity is lower with a value of 0.44. The graph does therefore show assortative tendencies for both of those values. For degree, it was pretty neutral with a value of -0.0185. For the composite score, there was no sign of significant assortativity, since the value is 0.12. This suggests on this measure, airports are not connected to other airports of high quality.</p><p>The next we did was to look at the BNP per capita. What we found here was that there was a correlation between the amount of international connection and the BNP per capita. For each airport, it is 0.1, which is a very low correlation value.</p><p>To get another point of view on the best airports, we looked at the communities in the network. The first we discovered was that the network had few major communities, which tend to have one major continent to belong to. Therefore, we split the graph into all the continents and looked at where the top 100 airports of composite score belonged. We found that most of these airports were located in and around Europe, but also in Asia and North America. Then we looked at the correlation between different values. First, there seems to be a correlation with the top 100 when looking at degree, edges and nodes. What we then found was that there is a correlation between BNP per capita and the composite score of around 0.6. But to the score depending on centrality, we did expect that Europe would have more than the others. This answers the third research question, indicating that the best airports are located in Europe when adjusted for a BNP measure for regional development.</p><p>The last thing was to include the average recommendation. We found that there is no sign of assortativity between airports in regards to the average recommendation. This means that highly popular airports do not necessarily connect more with other airports of high ratings. In general, we found that the average recommendation was negatively correlated with BNP per capita, suggesting that the economy of the country the airport is located in is not everything. But this will be answered in greater detail in the next section.</p><hr class="border-b-2 border-gray-400 mt-8 mx-4"><div class="font-sans flex justify-between content-center px-4 pb-12"><div class=text-left><p><a href=../data-description class="break-normal text-base md:text-sm text-green-500 font-bold no-underline hover:underline">&lt;
