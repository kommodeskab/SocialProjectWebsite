Finally, we wanted to visualzie the numerical ratings of the airports around the world. We wanted to get a general view of how airports are rated all around the world. Therefore, we decided to fit a [Gaussian Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) to the dataset, such that the input features are the latitude and longitude coordinates of the airports, and the target variable is the fraction of positive reviews. Therefore, the target values falls in the range [0, 1], where 0 means no positive reviews, and 1 means only positive reviews. We used a Radial Basis Function with lengthscale \(l=15\) latitude/longitude degrees. A very useful feature of using a Gaussian Process is the fact that the model actually outputs a probability distribution over the target values, enabling us to mask out areas where the model is not able to determine the target value within an certain error (we went with a max standard deviation of 0.15). Especially in the northern regions, around greenland and northern Russia, there is basically no airport reviews, resulting in a high error. These regions have been colored grey.

Given more time, it could have been very interesting to further explore the use of a Gaussian Processes to visualize airport ratings. In particular, one could investigate:
* [Graph kernels](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/borovitskiy21a/borovitskiy21a.pdf), a kind of kernel that does not consider spatial distance between points, but instead their connectivity as described by edges in a graph. Kernels can be added, giving us the ability to consider BOTH spatial distance and graph connectivity between airports.
* The parameter \\(\alpha\\), which determines the error in each point, where an airport with a review exists. In the above visualization, we fixed \\(\alpha = 0.15\\), but alternatively it could be interesting to calculate a more exact error in each point using a Beta-distribution, i.e. by also considering the number of reviews.

title: Textual Analysis

As it will turn out later, wordclouds, TF, and TF-IDF will not be very informative for this task. This is because the reviews are too similar in subject matter and the communities simply do not differentiate themselves enough in the language used. The vocabulary being used is repetitive and is very narrow in it's scope. This is why we will use sentiment analysis to investigate the reviews. This will allow us a different insight from the reviews. The vader package is highly sofisticated and is able to detect the sentiment of a text. We will use this to analyze the reviews. The library is a pre-trained model that knows how to deal with negation, capitalization, emoticons, etc.. Therefore we will not tokenize or stem the text for this task. We will simply use the text as it is. We will use the compound score to determine the sentiment of the review. The compound score is a normalized score that ranges from -1 to 1. We will use this score to determine the sentiment of the review. Then it is easy to plot each community(continent) and see how the sentiment of the continents airports differ. There are 6 continents in this analysis with different amounts of reviews. Number of reviews for each: North America(1432), Europe(6207), Africa(1096), Oceania(7112), Asia(1646), South America(377). This is a considerable amount of data and should hopefully be representative for each community, since it originates from many different airports in each community.
