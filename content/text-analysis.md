Finally, we wanted to visualzie the numerical ratings of the airports around the world. We wanted to get a general view of how airports are rated all around the world. Therefore, we decided to fit a [Gaussian Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) to the dataset, such that the input features are the latitude and longitude coordinates of the airports, and the target variable is the fraction of positive reviews. Therefore, the target values falls in the range [0, 1], where 0 means no positive reviews, and 1 means only positive reviews. We used a Radial Basis Function with lengthscale = 15 latitude/longitude degrees. A very useful feature of using a Gaussian Process is the fact that the model actually outputs a probability distribution over the target values, enabling us to mask out areas where the model is not able to determine the target value within an certain error (we went with a max standard deviation of 0.15). Especially in the northern regions, around greenland and northern Russia, there is basically no airport reviews, resulting in a high error. These regions have been colored grey.

Given more time, it could have been very interesting to explore the use of a Gaussian Processes to visualize airport ratings. In particular, one could investigate:
* [Graph kernels](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/borovitskiy21a/borovitskiy21a.pdf), a kind of kernel that does not consider spatial distance between points, but instead their connectivity as described by edges in a graph. Kernels can be added, giving us the ability to consider BOTH spatial distance and graph connectivity between airports.
* The parameter alpha, which determines the error in each point, where an airport with a review exists. In the above visualization, we fixed alpha = 0.1, but alternatively it could be interesting to calculate a more exact error in each point using a Beta-distribution, i.e. by also considering the number of reviews.
